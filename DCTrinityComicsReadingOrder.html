                    Superman was introduced in 1938 and was 
                    one of the first superheroes in comic book 
                    history. He became so widely successful that
                    he created an entire subgenre of fiction. People 
                    tend to write him off as a boring character, 
                    but his best stories are full of fun, whimsy, action 
                    and hope. This is a list of essential Superman 
                    stories to read if you want to get to know the character.

                    Alternate Starting Point
                </h1>
                <p>Superman has a LOT of comic books (obviously because 
                    he debuted before World War 2!), so it can be very 
                    daunting to get into his comics. If you want, you can 
                    start from his very first appearance in Action Comics 
                    (1938) #1. However, if you don't want to read almost 
                    8 decades of comics, then feel free to start with 
                    these comics listed below.
